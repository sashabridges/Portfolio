Originally a database just for Mabinogi's Handicraft List.

Now delving further into a complete project to database the entire Mabinogi Crafting List

#Now includes a database for Magic Craft, Potion Making, and Weaving!

Next up:
Carpentry!

#Eventually will have:
-Hillwen Engineering List
-Tailoring List
-Blacksmithing List
-Synthesis List
-Fragmentation List
-Carpentry List
-Fishing List

Will eventually contain Skills.

Eventually, this database will be the backend of my Java SkillCalc and my ASP.NET Crafting Database.

Known issues:
- Does not include the Far Darrig Bag items, including Shiny String (Weaving) or Far Darrig Bag (Handicraft). Will change at a later date.
