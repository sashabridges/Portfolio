# Portfolio

Inside each folder will be projects for each individual language or framework
EX: HTML will have HTML, NodeJS will have Node.js, SQL will have SQL, and so on.

Currently, the following folders have a project in them:
- APIs: Takes data from the OpenWeatherAPI and creates scatterplots through Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
- JavaScript: Utilizes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Leaflet to create a website. It's very pink. :)
- SQL: Has a singular SQL table full of data from the MabinogiWorld wiki.
- NodeJS: A quick Notes App


What to expect later:
- A Visual Basic project
- An ASP.NET project
- A C++ project
- A Java project
- A Ruby project
- Another Python project
