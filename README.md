# Portfolio

Inside each folder will be projects for each individual language or framework
EX: HTML will have HTML, NodeJS will have Node.js, SQL will have SQL, and so on.

Currently, the following folders have a project in them:
- APIs: Takes data from the OpenWeatherAPI and creates scatterplots through Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
- JavaScript: Utilizes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Leaflet to create a website. It's very pink. :)
- SQL: Has a singular SQL table full of data from the MabinogiWorld wiki.
- NodeJS: A quick Notes App


What to expect later:
- A Visual Basic project
- An ASP.NET project
- A C++ project
- A Java project
- A Ruby project
- Another Python project

## APIs

This Python program takes randomly generated Latitudes and Longitudes and finds the nearest cities through Citipy. Then, the program references those cities and runs them through the OpenWeatherAPI to get weather data such as humidity, cloudiness, temperature, and wind speeds and plots them on a chart with Matplotlib.

## SQL

This SQL code creates a database for the Mabinogi Handicraft crafting list as well as the Magic Craft crafting list. The Magic Craft DB also comes with some sample queries for searching for individual items.
