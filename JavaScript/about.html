<h1>Sasha's Personal Bio</h1>
<hr>
</div>

<div id ="yeeeee">
<br>
<br>
<p>I'm Sasha, I live in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
<p>I like computers. I do stuff for people.</p>
<p>I like working with SQL, Python, C++, Ruby, and Visual Basic.</p>
<p>I want to learn PHP, Bootstrap, and NodeJS.</p>
<p>I'm trying to learn to like CSS and JavaScript. It's a work in progress! Please bear with me.</p>



<p>I have a lot of hobbies!</p>
<p>My top hobbies are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mabinogi, a Korean MMORPG that I've been playing since 2008.</li>
	<li>Forcing people to try my cooking creations. (They're not that bad, I promise.)</li>
	<li>Reading! I love visual novels, manga, fanfiction, and my kindle. I can't stop buying HumbleBundle book bundles! Help!</li>
	<li>Learning on CodeAcademy.</li>
	<li>Updating the MabinogiWorld wiki or stealing their data and throwing it into my own database.</li>
	<li>Playing my Vita and my 3DS. Though lately the Switch is getting a lot of attention.</li>
	<li>Playing with my cat, Nugget.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some more in-depth information!</p>
<p>I use to play a card game called Sword Girls Online, and the very first website I built with HTML was a SGO site called AdeptJaina. </p>
<p>My favorite factions were Vita and Darklore.</p>

<p>The first back-end programming language I learned was C++! I'm very fond of it, even though I've switched over to Python now.</p>
<p>Java is the second back-end language I learned, and while it has a lot of nifty frameworks, I'd rank it a lot lower on my list purely because my first teacher was awful.</p>
<p>My favorite teacher at Park University, Bin 'Crystal' Ping, taught me both SQL and Visual Basic, and those were the classes I enjoyed the most because they involved live coding in class and she expected us to actually <i>work</i> to learn material. I had her for four classes, but I would have gladly done four more with her.</p>
<p>Originally, I wanted to go into Networking, but I took one class and realized I hated it. Even a few years later I couldn't wrap my head around all the memorization. </p>

<p>One of my life-long dreams is to make a Visual Novels through Java.</p>
<p>Back when Cosmic Break was still popular, I really wanted to make a Visual Novel for it specifically.</p>
<p><img src="img/WikiLogo2.png"></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, I play Mabinogi and I'm a member of the MabinogiWorld wiki where I tend to make a lot of stubs for new items. I like to find flavor text and add them to the wiki.</p>
<p>I also want to create a Mabinogi Skill Calculator.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to make a Harvest Moon/Animal Crossing-esque game some day, with randomized villages and crops.</p>
<p><img src="img/DWM_book.png"></p>
<p>Monster-capture games like Pokemon, Yo-kai Watch, and Dragon Warrior Monsters are my favorite.</p>
<p>I've tried making rom hacks of Pokemon before. It was fun! I'd probably enjoy it more that I know how to program.</p>
<p>I also enjoy making RPGmaker games.</p>
