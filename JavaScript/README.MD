A website displaying general front-end HTML/CSS/BootStrap/JavaScript/Leaflet skills.

Index is the Home Page.
From the Index you may visit my About page, my Contact page, my Github, my LinkenIn, and an on-site portfolio.

My About page lists a few things about me, such as my hobbies and interests.

My on-site portfolio has a visualization of my current skillset, made in CSS. It also has links to my projects.
Current projects include:
- A Leaflet map that shows what places I've been to
- Data Visualizations of climate data and the impact of temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed based on Latitude/Longitude
- A Web Scraping and API project that takes data from Serebii.net and Pokeapi.co and uses SQLAlchemy to turn it into a SQLite database
